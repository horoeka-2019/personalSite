Build https://jillglass.github.io/index.html in React

Finished site:  https://jillglass.herokuapp.com

I built my personal site with vanilla js and html/css in vs code.  This project sees me create the same site with React JS. I have selected to use vanilla CSS to show that I can build CSS in this way as well as using a CSS framework, as highlighted by my other project, Wheko.

I am following designs from a senior UX Designer to showcase how I can take beautiful designs and bring them to life.
