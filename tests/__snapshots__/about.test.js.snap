          My Story
        </strong>
        <div>
          In 2018, with over seven years of marketing experience under my belt, I decided - after taking a break to raise my children - to redirect my career. The first step towards this was to enrol with Girl Code to gain some insight and experience into the dev world and solidify the direction I wanted to take. After Girl Code levels 1 and 2 I enrolled in Enspiral Dev Academy, taking my career full-circle: at 18 I studied Multimedia at SEO in Auckland. 20 years later I am back on that track and am very excited about the future.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          I am a highly focused, organised and collaborative team member who values and fosters a great team culture and who enjoys a fun and hardworking team environment. I enjoy learning from others and I have a curious nature; with my background in marketing, having worked both agency and client side, I understand the necessity of great UX/UI design.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          I also have experience in managing internal stakeholders and clients as well as external clients, building strong, ongoing relationships. I have built web apps using React (including Redux) and Github and have an interest in mobile development - a personal project of mine which I designed and wireframed is now getting off the ground in React Native.
