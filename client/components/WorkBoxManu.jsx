      He Pokai Manu is the bird-spotting app that I made as part of a team of four for my final project at EDA.  We did not cover CSS or any associated frameworks as part of the bootcamp, which shows a little in our final design!  This was built in 6 days, from idea to completion.  It was built as a PWA and is best viewed at a mobile viewport size.
