      Wheko is a bird spotting app that I have created in React.  It is based off the final project I did at Dev Academy, in which my idea was chosen to take through to fruition - a bird spotting app for kids.  I have built this idea out further and have used designs from a senior UX designer, to showcase how I can take a design and bring it to life.
